#Drupal Settings Docs
This repository holds multiple environment setting configuration for Pantheon, Acquia and a self-hosted LAMP stack.

##Environment Indicator module
These settings also feature configuration for Sassy and Prepro modules, but they are not essential to this set up. :) Environment indicator is a great module to have in this case, and especially because you can change the indication settings in settings.php.
