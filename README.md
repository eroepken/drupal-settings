#Drupal Settings Docs
This repository holds multiple environment setting configuration for Pantheon, Acquia and a self-hosted LAMP stack. Required code to make this work is in each settings.php file which points to its own respective settings.environment.php files.

##Environment Indicator module
These settings also feature configuration for Sassy/Prepro modules and some caching and error reporting settings, but they are not essential to this set up. :) Environment indicator is a great module to have in this case, and especially because you can change the indication settings in settings.php.
